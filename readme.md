jHeroesQuest, a Java-3D game I developed in 2008 as part of a practical exam.

There are still many things to do to make it real fun to play. 
The first thing should be usage of i18n to translate the content into english.
Another would be a refactoring to extract methods and classes to clean up the code.

features:
- 3D board game in a Swing UI
- save/load games
- sound
- a map model to create new boards to play on
- 2 players fight against each other round based (no AI)
- algorithms like discovering new entered rooms ...
